## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

While doing this challengte, I gained some major knowledge about Grid and Flexbox. I actually tried to complete this challengee about a month ago using Tables! Then I learned about Grid and Flex, and tried again using those tools. Now I suppose I didn't do a horrile job here :)


### Continued development

I would very much like to continue learning more about Grid, Flex, Position, and Display properties of CSS.
